  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    Hi, We're two brothers who play MapleLegends because we wanted to feel the
    nostalgic experience again.
  </p>

  <p>
    We wanted to open stores in FM to earn some mesos, but didn't know how to
    price our items. We created <a href="/">Maple Heaven</a> to help us easily find
    items data and market prices. We hope it will help you too.
  </p>

  <p>
    Maple Heaven project is developed using <a
      href="https://kit.svelte.dev/"
      target="_blank">SvelteKit</a
    > and the data presented on our website is based on
    <a href="https://owlrepo.com/" target="_blank">OwlRepo.com</a>
    with a friendly UI combining item icons and item data from
    <a href="https://bbb.hidden-street.net/" target="_blank"
      >Hidden-Street.net (before big bang)</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Special Thanks to <a href="https://geospiza.me/" target="_blank">geospiza</a
    > the creator of OwlRepo, we couldn't have done this project without your special
    work!
     We encourage all our users to <a href="https://owlrepo.com/upload" target="_blank">upload 'Owl Of Mirvena' Screenshots to OwlRepo</a> so the market prices stay up-to-date.
  </p>
