  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    Hi, We're two brothers who play MapleLegends because we wanted to feel the
    nostalgic experience again.
  </p>

  <p>
    We wanted to open stores in FM to earn some mesos, but didn't know how to
    price our items. We created <a href="/">Maple Heaven</a> to help us easily find items data
    and market prices.
  </p>

  <p>
    Maple Heaven project is developed using <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/" target="_blank">SvelteKit</a>, and the data presented on
    our website is based on <a href="https://owlrepo.com/" target="_blank"
      >OwlRepo.com</a
    >
    with a friendly UI combining item icons and item data from
    <a href="https://bbb.hidden-street.net/" target="_blank"
      >Hidden-Street.net (before big bang)</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    Feel free to <a

    >.
